DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       A typical Linux system has, among others, the following directories:

       _/      This is the root directory.  This is where the whole tree starts.

       _/_b_i_n   This directory contains executable programs which are needed in single user mode and to bring the system up or repair it.

       _/_b_o_o_t  Contains  static  files for the boot loader.  This directory holds only the files which are needed during the boot process.  The map
              installer and configuration files should go to _/_s_b_i_n and _/_e_t_c.  The operating system kernel (initrd for example) must be located  in
              either _/ or _/_b_o_o_t.

       _/_d_e_v   Special or device files, which refer to physical devices.  See mmkknnoodd(1).

       _/_e_t_c   Contains  configuration files which are local to the machine.  Some larger software packages, like X11, can have their own subdirec‐
              tories below _/_e_t_c.  Site-wide configuration files may be placed here or in _/_u_s_r_/_e_t_c.  Nevertheless, programs should always look  for
              these files in _/_e_t_c and you may have links for these files to _/_u_s_r_/_e_t_c.

       _/_e_t_c_/_o_p_t
              Host-specific configuration files for add-on applications installed in _/_o_p_t.

       _/_e_t_c_/_s_g_m_l
              This directory contains the configuration files for SGML (optional).

       _/_e_t_c_/_s_k_e_l
              When a new user account is created, files from this directory are usually copied into the user's home directory.

       _/_e_t_c_/_X_1_1
              Configuration files for the X11 window system (optional).

       _/_e_t_c_/_x_m_l
              This directory contains the configuration files for XML (optional).

       _/_h_o_m_e  On  machines  with  home  directories  for  users, these are usually beneath this directory, directly or not.  The structure of this
              directory depends on local administration decisions (optional).

       _/_l_i_b   This directory should hold those shared libraries that are necessary to boot the system and to run the commands in the root filesys‐
              tem.

       _/_l_i_b_<_q_u_a_l_>
              These directories are variants of _/_l_i_b on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries (optional).

       _/_l_i_b_/_m_o_d_u_l_e_s
              Loadable kernel modules (optional).

       _/_l_o_s_t_+_f_o_u_n_d
              This  directory contains items lost in the filesystem.  These items are usually chunks of files mangled as a consequence of a faulty
              disk or a system crash.

       _/_m_e_d_i_a This directory contains mount points for removable media such as CD and DVD disks or USB sticks.  On systems  where  more  than  one
              device  exists  for  mounting  a  certain  type of media, mount directories can be created by appending a digit to the name of those
              available above starting with '0', but the unqualified name must also exist.

       _/_m_e_d_i_a_/_f_l_o_p_p_y_[_1_-_9_]
              Floppy drive (optional).

       _/_m_e_d_i_a_/_c_d_r_o_m_[_1_-_9_]
              CD-ROM drive (optional).

       _/_m_e_d_i_a_/_c_d_r_e_c_o_r_d_e_r_[_1_-_9_]
              CD writer (optional).

       _/_m_e_d_i_a_/_z_i_p_[_1_-_9_]
              Zip drive (optional).

       _/_m_e_d_i_a_/_u_s_b_[_1_-_9_]
              USB drive (optional).

       _/_m_n_t   This directory is a mount point for a temporarily mounted filesystem.  In some distributions, _/_m_n_t contains subdirectories  intended
              to be used as mount points for several temporary filesystems.

       _/_o_p_t   This directory should contain add-on packages that contain static files.

       _/_p_r_o_c  This  is  a  mount  point  for the _p_r_o_c filesystem, which provides information about running processes and the kernel.  This pseudo-
              filesystem is described in more detail in pprroocc(5).

       _/_r_o_o_t  This directory is usually the home directory for the root user (optional).

       _/_s_b_i_n  Like _/_b_i_n, this directory holds commands needed to boot the system, but which are usually not executed by normal users.

       _/_s_r_v   This directory contains site-specific data that is served by this system.

       _/_s_y_s   This is a mount point for the sysfs filesystem, which provides information about the kernel like _/_p_r_o_c, but better structured,  fol‐
              lowing the formalism of kobject infrastructure.

       _/_t_m_p   This directory contains temporary files which may be deleted with no notice, such as by a regular job or at system boot up.

       _/_u_s_r   This  directory  is  usually  mounted  from  a separate partition.  It should hold only shareable, read-only data, so that it can be
              mounted by various machines running Linux.

       _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6
              The X-Window system, version 11 release 6 (optional).

       _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6_/_b_i_n
              Binaries which belong to the X-Window system; often, there is a symbolic link from the more traditional _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_X_1_1 to here.

       _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6_/_l_i_b
              Data files associated with the X-Window system.

       _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6_/_l_i_b_/_X_1_1
              These contain miscellaneous files needed to run X;  Often, there is a symbolic link from _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_X_1_1 to this directory.

       _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_X_1_1
              Contains include files needed for compiling  programs  using  the  X11  window  system.   Often,  there  is  a  symbolic  link  from
              _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_X_1_1 to this directory.

       _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n
              This  is  the primary directory for executable programs.  Most programs executed by normal users which are not needed for booting or
              for repairing the system and which are not installed locally should be placed in this directory.

       _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_m_h
              Commands for the MH mail handling system (optional).

       _/_u_s_r_/_b_i_n_/_X_1_1
              is the traditional place to look for X11 executables; on Linux, it usually is a symbolic link to _/_u_s_r_/_X_1_1_R_6_/_b_i_n.

       _/_u_s_r_/_d_i_c_t

              Replaced by _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e_/_d_o_c.

       _/_u_s_r_/_e_t_c
              Site-wide configuration files to be shared between several machines may be stored  in  this  directory.   However,  commands  should
              always reference those files using the _/_e_t_c directory.  Links from files in _/_e_t_c should point to the appropriate files in _/_u_s_r_/_e_t_c.

       _/_u_s_r_/_g_a_m_e_s
              Binaries for games and educational programs (optional).

              Include files which declare some assembler functions.  This used to be a symbolic link to _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c_/_l_i_n_u_x_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_a_s_m.

       _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_l_i_n_u_x
              This  contains  information  which  may  change  from  system  release  to  system  release  and  used  to  be  a  symbolic  link to
              _/_u_s_r_/_s_r_c_/_l_i_n_u_x_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_l_i_n_u_x to get at operating-system-specific information.

              (Note that one should have include files there that work correctly with the current libc and in user space.  However,  Linux  kernel
              source  is  not  designed  to be used with user programs and does not know anything about the libc you are using.  It is very likely
              that things will break if you let _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_a_s_m and _/_u_s_r_/_i_n_c_l_u_d_e_/_l_i_n_u_x point at a random kernel tree.  Debian  systems  don't  do
              this and use headers from a known good kernel version, provided in the libc*-dev package.)

       _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b
              Object  libraries, including dynamic libraries, plus some executables which usually are not invoked directly.  More complicated pro‐
              grams may have whole subdirectories there.

       _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_<_q_u_a_l_>
              These directories are variants of _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b on system which support more than one binary format requiring separate libraries,  except
              that the symbolic link _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_<_q_u_a_l_>_/_X_1_1 is not required (optional).

       _/_u_s_r_/_l_i_b_/_X_1_1
              The usual place for data files associated with X programs, and configuration files for the X system itself.  On Linux, it usually is

       _/_u_s_r_/_s_b_i_n
              This  directory contains program binaries for system administration which are not essential for the boot process, for mounting _/_u_s_r,
              or for system repair.

       _/_u_s_r_/_s_h_a_r_e
